Subject: Collaboration Opportunity: Elevating Animation Excellence with Alight Motion

Dear Team Alight Motion,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Chinurag, and I am an animator who deeply admires the innovative work your company has achieved with Alight Motion. The core principle of "reimagining creativity" and your commitment to empowering artists align perfectly with my own passion for animation.

As I explored the Alight Motion website, I was captivated by the world's first professional motion graphics toolset for mobile platforms. It is truly inspiring to witness how your app enables creators to craft stunning motion designs, videos, and animations with unparalleled ease and precision. From keyframe animation to video compositing to visual effects, Alight Motion empowers artists to bring their visions to life on their iPhone, iPad, Mac (with Apple Silicon), or Android device.

I am thrilled to present my work and demonstrate my compatibility with the ethos of Alight Motion. Enclosed in this email, you will find samples showcasing my previous animations, all created with the Alight Motion app. These examples highlight the incredible potential that can be achieved using your application, particularly in the realm of vector illustration. By combining the creative possibilities of Alight Motion with my artistic sensibilities, we can unlock a new realm of animation excellence.

Allow me to elaborate on the collaboration opportunity that has led me to reach out to you today. I currently manage two YouTube channels: "Chinurag" with 22k subscribers (youtube.com/chinurag) and "Rag Army" with 28k subscribers (youtube.com/@rag_army_). On my Chinurag channel, I create captivating animation stories based on real-life events, most of which are brought to life using Alight Motion. Meanwhile, on Rag Army, I focus on providing tutorials on "how to make animation on a phone." While my tutorials are currently in Hindi, I am planning to expand into English, broadening the reach of my content.

The demand for high-quality animation tutorials is soaring, and I firmly believe that Alight Motion has the potential to become the go-to mobile animation platform. Many animators lack access to powerful PCs capable of running complex animation software. By harnessing the capabilities of Alight Motion, individuals can create, exchange, and sell vector-made characters and backgrounds, ushering in a new era of creative collaboration.

I am excited to propose a collaboration that will elevate the Alight Motion community to new heights. Through informative and engaging videos, I can showcase the various features and capabilities of Alight Motion while highlighting the transformative potential of vector illustration. Together, we can nurture a vibrant community of Alight Motion Animators, fostering knowledge sharing, and inspiring artists to push the boundaries of their creativity.

I kindly invite you to review the attached samples, which exemplify the quality and versatility achievable through Alight Motion. I am confident that my skills, dedication, and vision align perfectly with your esteemed company's goals and aspirations.

Thank you for considering this collaboration opportunity. I eagerly await your response and the chance to contribute to the growth and success of Alight Motion.

Best regards,

Chinurag

I am thrilled to offer my collaboration to create informative and engaging videos for your YouTube channel. These videos will provide concise animation tutorials showcasing the various features and capabilities of Alight Motion, while also fostering a community of Alight Motion Animators. Furthermore, I can share insights on how animators can create their own characters or bring famous movie characters to life using your application.

However, it has come to my attention that despite Alight Motion's potential as an animator-friendly application, it has predominantly been utilized for video editing and AMV purposes. After analyzing your app's design and watching your YouTube videos, I firmly believe that you have envisioned it to be primarily geared towards animators. Nevertheless, due to the lack of sufficient tutorials, many individuals tend to gravitate towards alternatives such as FlipaClip (a frame-by-frame animation app) and other similar platforms.

Upon visiting the Alight Motion website and exploring its extensive features, I was captivated by the emphasis on world-class vector illustration. It is evident that your application enables users to create intricate and visually striking designs, unleashing their creativity like never before.

I am open to two potential avenues of collaboration:

I can create a dedicated playlist of videos for your YouTube channel, showcasing Alight Motion's functionalities and assisting users in maximizing their creativity. We can discuss a mutually agreeable sum for this service.

We can establish a paid collaboration, where I create engaging tutorial videos on my channel, highlighting the immense potential of Alight Motion. These videos can be shared on your app, reaching a broader audience and driving more users to explore the creative possibilities your platform offers.
